Disease,Description
Fungal infection,"Fungal infections or mycosis are diseases caused by a fungus (yeast or mold) Fungal infections are most common on your skin or nails  but fungi (plural of fungus) can also cause infections in your mouth throat lungs urinary tract and many other parts of your body.Fungal infections occur when harmful fungi invade the body, affecting skin (ringworm, athlete's foot), nails, mouth (thrush), lungs, or bloodstream. Common types include dermatophyte infections (itchy, scaly rashes), Candida (yeast causing oral/vaginal thrush), and Aspergillus (lung infections). Risk factors include weak immunity (HIV, diabetes), antibiotic use, and poor hygiene. Symptoms vary by type: skin infections cause redness/itching, while systemic infections lead to fever and fatigue. Treatment involves antifungal creams (clotrimazole), oral meds (fluconazole), or IV drugs for severe cases. Prevention includes keeping skin dry, avoiding contaminated surfaces, and managing underlying health conditions. Early treatment prevents complications."
Allergy,"An allergy is an overreaction of the immune system to harmless substances like pollen, dust, or certain foods. When exposed, the body releases histamines, causing symptoms such as sneezing, itching, rashes, or severe reactions like anaphylaxis. Common allergens include nuts, shellfish, pet dander, and insect stings. Diagnosis involves skin tests or blood work, and treatment includes antihistamines, steroids, or immunotherapy. Avoiding triggers is key to prevention. Severe cases may require emergency epinephrine. Allergies can develop at any age and range from mild discomfort to life-threatening conditions."
GERD,"GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)GERD occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, irritating its lining. This happens due to a weakened lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing. Risk factors include obesity, smoking, and acidic foods. Chronic GERD can lead to esophagitis, Barrett’s esophagus, or cancer. Treatment involves lifestyle changes (diet, weight loss), antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), or surgery in severe cases. Avoiding triggers like caffeine, alcohol, and large meals before bedtime helps manage symptoms."
Chronic cholestasis,"Chronic cholestasis is a condition where bile flow from the liver is reduced for a prolonged period.Chronic cholestasis is a long-term reduction in bile flow from the liver, leading to bile buildup. Causes include liver diseases (cirrhosis, hepatitis), bile duct obstructions, or genetic disorders. Symptoms include jaundice (yellow skin), severe itching, dark urine, and fatty stool (steatorrhea). Complications may involve vitamin deficiencies and liver damage. Diagnosis requires blood tests, imaging, or liver biopsy. Treatment focuses on managing the underlying cause, medications like ursodeoxycholic acid, or surgery for blockages. Severe cases may require liver transplantation. Early intervention prevents irreversible liver damage."
Drug Reaction,"Drug Reaction occurs when the body reacts adversely to a medication.A drug reaction is an adverse response to medication, ranging from mild rashes to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Common culprits include antibiotics (penicillin), NSAIDs, and anticonvulsants. Symptoms may include hives, swelling, fever, or organ damage (e.g., liver toxicity). Severe reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome require emergency care. Diagnosis involves reviewing medication history and allergy testing. Treatment includes stopping the drug, antihistamines, steroids, or epinephrine for anaphylaxis. Prevention involves informing doctors of known allergies and using alternative medications when necessary. Pharmacogenomic testing can help predict reactions in some cases."
Peptic ulcer disease,"Peptic ulcer disease involves sores that develop on the inner lining of the stomach and small intestine.Peptic ulcers are open sores in the stomach or small intestine lining, often caused by H. pylori infection or long-term NSAID use. Symptoms include burning stomach pain, bloating, nausea, or bleeding (black stools). Complications include perforation or obstruction. Diagnosis involves endoscopy, breath tests, or stool samples. Treatment includes antibiotics (for H. pylori), acid reducers (PPIs), and avoiding irritants like alcohol and smoking. Severe cases may require surgery. Lifestyle changes, such as stress management and a balanced diet, aid healing. Untreated ulcers can lead to serious internal bleeding."
AIDS,"AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is a disease caused by HIV that weakens the immune system.AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely damaged, making the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections (TB, pneumonia) and cancers (Kaposi’s sarcoma). HIV spreads via blood, sexual contact, or mother-to-child transmission. Symptoms include weight loss, chronic diarrhea, and recurrent infections. Diagnosis involves HIV antibody tests and viral load monitoring. While no cure exists, antiretroviral therapy (ART) controls the virus, prolonging life. Prevention includes safe sex, needle exchange programs, and PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). Early treatment prevents progression to AIDS. Regular medical care is essential for managing health."
Diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar.Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar due to insufficient insulin (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2). Symptoms include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and slow wound healing. Complications include nerve damage, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis involves blood glucose tests (A1C, fasting sugar). Management includes insulin injections, oral medications, diet control, and exercise. Type 2 can often be prevented with a healthy lifestyle. Uncontrolled diabetes leads to severe organ damage and life-threatening emergencies like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Regular monitoring and medical care are crucial for long-term health."
Gastroenteritis,"Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, typically caused by a virus or bacteria.Gastroenteritis, or stomach flu, is inflammation of the stomach and intestines, usually caused by viruses (norovirus, rotavirus) or bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella). Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, cramps, and fever. Dehydration is a major risk, especially in children. Treatment focuses on hydration (oral rehydration solutions), rest, and bland foods. Severe cases may require IV fluids or antibiotics (for bacterial causes). Prevention includes handwashing, safe food handling, and vaccines (rotavirus). Most cases resolve in a few days, but persistent symptoms warrant medical attention to rule out serious infections."
Bronchial Asthma,"Bronchial Asthma is a respiratory condition characterized by inflammation of the airways.Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, causing recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Triggers include allergens (pollen, dust mites), pollution, exercise, and stress. During an attack, airways narrow due to inflammation and muscle spasms, making breathing difficult. Diagnosis involves spirometry and peak flow tests. Treatment includes inhaled corticosteroids (long-term control) and bronchodilators (quick relief). Severe cases may require biologics. Avoiding triggers and using action plans help manage symptoms. Untreated asthma can lead to life-threatening attacks requiring emergency care."
Hypertension," Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common cardiovascular condition.Hypertension is a condition where blood pressure remains abnormally high (≥130/80 mmHg), straining the heart and blood vessels. Often asymptomatic, its called the 'silent killer' as it raises risks for heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Causes include genetics, obesity, high salt intake, and stress. Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, reducing alcohol) and medications (ACE inhibitors, diuretics) help control it. Regular monitoring is crucial. Uncontrolled hypertension can damage organs silently over time, emphasizing early detection and management."
Migraine,"Migraine is a type of headache that often involves severe pain and sensitivity to light and sound.Migraines are severe, throbbing headaches often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light/sound. Triggers include hormonal changes, stress, certain foods, and sleep disturbances. Some experience aura (visual disturbances) before onset. Treatment includes pain relievers (NSAIDs), triptans, and preventive medications (beta-blockers, CGRP inhibitors). Lifestyle modifications (hydration, stress management) reduce frequency. Chronic migraines can significantly impact quality of life, requiring specialized care"
Cervical spondylosis,"Cervical spondylosis is a degenerative condition of the cervical spine.A degenerative condition of the cervical spine (neck vertebrae), often due to aging or prolonged strain. Symptoms include neck pain, stiffness, and numbness in arms/hands from nerve compression. Diagnosis involves X-rays or MRI. Treatment includes physical therapy, pain relievers, and neck exercises. Severe cases may require surgery to relieve nerve pressure. Poor posture and sedentary habits worsen symptoms."
Paralysis (brain hemorrhage),"Paralysis (brain hemorrhage) refers to the loss of muscle function due to bleeding in the brain.Paralysis due to brain hemorrhage results from bleeding in the brain, damaging motor pathways. Causes include trauma, aneurysms, or hypertension. Symptoms depend on the affected area but may involve sudden weakness, speech loss, or coma. Emergency treatment focuses on stopping bleeding (surgery) and rehabilitation (physical therapy). Recovery varies; some regain function, while others face permanent disability."
Jaundice,"Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes, often indicating liver problems.Jaundice causes yellowing of the skin/eyes due to excess bilirubin, often from liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis), bile duct blockage, or hemolysis. Symptoms include dark urine and pale stools. Diagnosis requires liver function tests and imaging. Treatment targets the underlying cause (e.g., surgery for blockages, medications for hepatitis). Newborn jaundice is common but may need phototherapy."
Malaria,"Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals.A mosquito-borne parasitic disease (Plasmodium species) causing cyclic fever, chills, and anemia. Severe cases lead to organ failure. Diagnosis involves blood smears or rapid tests. Treatment includes antimalarials (artemisinin-based therapy). Prevention involves mosquito nets, repellents, and prophylactic drugs in endemic areas. Drug resistance is a growing concern."
Chicken pox,"Chicken pox is a highly contagious viral infection causing an itchy rash.A highly contagious viral infection (varicella-zoster) causing itchy blisters, fever, and fatigue. Spread via airborne droplets or direct contact. Vaccination prevents severe cases. Treatment focuses on symptom relief (antihistamines, calamine lotion). Adults may develop shingles later from the same virus."
Dengue,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection causing flu-like symptoms.A viral infection transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causing high fever, severe joint pain (breakbone fever), and rash. Severe dengue (hemorrhagic fever) leads to plasma leakage and shock. No specific treatment exists; supportive care (hydration) is vital. Prevention relies on mosquito control and avoiding bites."
Typhoid,"Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms.A bacterial (Salmonella Typhi) infection from contaminated food/water, causing prolonged fever, weakness, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis involves blood/stool cultures. Treatment includes antibiotics (azithromycin, ceftriaxone). Vaccination and clean water access prevent outbreaks. Untreated cases risk intestinal perforation."
hepatitis A,"hepatitis A is a viral liver disease.Hepatitis A is a highly contagious viral infection of the liver transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food/water or direct contact with an infected person. Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and dark urine. Unlike other hepatitis types, it doesn't cause chronic liver disease. Diagnosis involves antibody blood tests. Treatment focuses on rest, hydration, and nutrition since the body typically clears the virus on its own within months. Prevention includes proper sanitation, handwashing, and vaccination (recommended for travelers and high-risk groups). Most recover completely with lifelong immunity afterward."
Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver.Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by HBV, transmitted through blood, sexual contact, or from mother to baby during childbirth. It can be acute or chronic (lasting >6 months). Chronic HBV may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Many show no symptoms initially; when present, they include jaundice, joint pain, and abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis involves blood tests for antigens/antibodies. Treatment includes antivirals (tenofovir, entecavir) to suppress viral replication. Vaccination provides 98% protection. Chronic carriers require regular monitoring for liver damage. Safe sex and needle practices prevent transmission."
Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation.Hepatitis C is a bloodborne viral infection causing liver inflammation, often progressing silently to chronic disease. Primary transmission routes include shared needles, unsterile medical equipment, or blood transfusions (pre-1992). Symptoms may not appear until advanced liver damage (cirrhosis) occurs. Diagnosis requires HCV antibody and RNA testing. Modern direct-acting antivirals (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) cure >95% of cases in 8-12 weeks. No vaccine exists; prevention focuses on harm reduction (sterile needles) and blood screening. Left untreated, HCV can cause liver failure or cancer, making early detection crucial."
Hepatitis D,"Hepatitis D is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus.Hepatitis D (delta hepatitis) is a defective virus that only infects those already infected with HBV. It requires HBV's surface protein to replicate, worsening liver damage. Transmission mirrors HBV (blood/body fluids). Symptoms are more severe than HBV alone, with rapid progression to cirrhosis. Diagnosis involves detecting HDV RNA or antibodies. Treatment focuses on controlling HBV with pegylated interferon as the only currently effective option. Prevention relies on HBV vaccination (which also prevents HDV). Those with chronic HBV should avoid HDV exposure through safe practices. HDV-HBV coinfection has the worst prognosis among viral hepatitides."
Hepatitis E,"Hepatitis E is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation.Hepatitis E is an acute liver infection caused by HEV, primarily spread through fecal-contaminated water in developing countries. Symptoms resemble HAV (jaundice, fever, nausea), but pregnant women (especially in 3rd trimester) face up to 30% mortality from fulminant hepatitis. Diagnosis involves IgM antibody testing. Treatment is supportive; ribavirin may be used in severe cases. Prevention requires clean water access and proper sanitation. A vaccine exists in China but isn't widely available globally. Most cases resolve spontaneously, though immunocompromised patients may develop chronic infection. Travelers to endemic areas should avoid tap water/ice."
Alcoholic hepatitis,"Alcoholic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver due to alcohol consumption.Alcoholic hepatitis is liver inflammation caused by excessive alcohol consumption, typically over years. It ranges from mild to life-threatening (with 30-50% mortality in severe cases). Symptoms include jaundice, ascites (abdominal fluid), and hepatic encephalopathy (confusion). Diagnosis combines history, elevated liver enzymes (AST>ALT), and sometimes biopsy. Treatment mandates complete alcohol cessation. Severe cases may require corticosteroids or pentoxifylline; malnutrition is addressed with nutritional support. Liver transplantation may be considered for abstinent patients meeting criteria. Prognosis depends on severity and continued abstinence. Even with recovery, cirrhosis may develop if drinking continues."
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs.Tuberculosis is an airborne bacterial infection (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) primarily attacking lungs but can affect any organ. Active TB symptoms include chronic cough (sometimes bloody), night sweats, weight loss, and fever. Latent TB has no symptoms but can reactivate. Diagnosis involves sputum tests, chest X-rays, or interferon-gamma release assays. Treatment requires 6+ months of multiple antibiotics (isoniazid, rifampin). Drug-resistant TB (MDR/XDR-TB) needs longer, more toxic regimens. BCG vaccine offers partial protection. TB remains a global pandemic, worsened by HIV coinfection. DOTS (Directly Observed Therapy) ensures treatment adherence to prevent resistance."
Common Cold,"Common Cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract.The common cold is a viral upper respiratory tract infection caused by >200 virus types (mainly rhinoviruses). Symptoms include runny nose, sore throat, sneezing, and mild cough lasting 7-10 days. Transmission occurs via droplets or contaminated surfaces. Antibiotics are ineffective; treatment focuses on rest, hydration, and OTC meds (decongestants, pain relievers). Zinc and vitamin C may slightly reduce duration. Prevention involves hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with infected individuals. While generally mild, colds can exacerbate asthma or lead to secondary infections (sinusitis, ear infections) in vulnerable groups. Frequent colds (2-4/year in adults) reflect normal immune exposure."
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition affecting the air sacs in the lungs.Pneumonia is an acute respiratory infection causing lung air sac inflammation, often filling them with pus. Causes include bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae most common), viruses (flu, RSV), or fungi. Symptoms feature fever, productive cough, chest pain, and breathing difficulty. Diagnosis combines clinical exam, chest X-ray, and sputum tests. Treatment depends on cause: antibiotics (bacterial), antivirals, or antifungals. Severe cases may require hospitalization and oxygen. Vaccines (pneumococcal, flu) prevent many cases. At-risk groups (elderly, infants, immunocompromised) have higher mortality. Post-viral bacterial pneumonia is a frequent flu complication."
Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles),"Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles) is a condition characterized by swollen blood vessels in the rectum.Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum/anus, classified as internal (above dentate line) or external. Causes include chronic constipation, straining, pregnancy, or prolonged sitting. Symptoms range from painless bleeding to severe throbbing pain and prolapse. Diagnosis involves visual inspection or anoscopy. Treatment includes fiber-rich diet, sitz baths, topical creams (hydrocortisone), or procedures (rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy). Surgery (hemorrhoidectomy) is reserved for severe/recurrent cases. Prevention focuses on avoiding straining, exercise, and hydration. While common (affecting 50% of adults by 50), persistent bleeding warrants colonoscopy to rule out colorectal cancer."
Heart attack,"Heart attack is a sudden and severe reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle.A heart attack occurs when coronary artery blockage (usually by a blood clot) starves heart muscle of oxygen ,causing irreversible damage. Symptoms include crushing chest pain radiating to arm/jaw, sweating, nausea, and shortness of breath. 'Silent' MIs may occur in diabetics. Diagnosis involves ECG and troponin blood tests. Emergency treatment includes aspirin, nitroglycerin, and reperfusion (angioplasty/stents or thrombolytics). Post-MI care involves beta-blockers, statins, and cardiac rehab. Risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes) require long-term management. Prompt treatment is critical—every minute delay increases heart muscle loss. Women may present with atypical symptoms (fatigue, indigestion)."
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted veins that usually appear on the legs.Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted superficial veins caused by valve failure, allowing blood pooling. Risk factors include genetics, prolonged standing, obesity, and pregnancy. Symptoms involve aching, heaviness, swelling, and visible blue bulging veins. Complications include ulcers, bleeding, or DVT. Diagnosis is clinical, with ultrasound assessing deep vein function. Treatment includes compression stockings, sclerotherapy (injecting solution to collapse veins), or endovenous ablation (laser/radiofrequency). Surgery (vein stripping) is rare now. Prevention focuses on exercise, elevation, and weight control. While often cosmetic, symptomatic cases benefit from intervention to prevent progression."
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.Hypothyroidism is underproduction of thyroid hormones (T3/T4), slowing metabolism. Primary causes include Hashimoto's autoimmune disease, iodine deficiency, or thyroid surgery. Symptoms develop slowly: fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, and depression. Diagnosis shows high TSH with low free T4. Treatment is daily levothyroxine (synthetic T4), dosed based on weight and adjusted via TSH monitoring. Untreated cases risk myxedema coma (life-threatening). Subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal T4) may require treatment if symptomatic. Iodized salt prevents deficiency-related cases. Most patients require lifelong medication with periodic dose adjustments."
Hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood sugar levels.Hypoglycemia is abnormally low blood glucose (<70 mg/dL), commonly in diabetics from excess insulin/oral meds. Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, confusion, and seizures if severe. The 'hypoglycemic unawareness' phenomenon in long-standing diabetes is dangerous. Treatment is 15g fast-acting carbs (glucose tablets, juice) followed by protein. Glucagon injections treat unconscious episodes. Recurrent episodes require medication adjustment. Non-diabetic hypoglycemia may stem from insulinomas, alcohol, or critical illnesses. Continuous glucose monitors help prevent episodes. Prolonged hypoglycemia can cause permanent brain damage, making prompt treatment essential."
Osteoarthristis,"Osteoarthristis is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage in joints.Osteoarthritis (OA) is degenerative joint disease from cartilage breakdown, causing bone-on-bone friction. Risk factors include aging, obesity, joint injury, and genetics. Symptoms are joint pain, stiffness (worse after inactivity), and reduced mobility. Commonly affects knees, hips, and hands (Heberden's nodes). Diagnosis is clinical with X-ray confirmation. Treatment includes weight loss, exercise (low-impact like swimming), NSAIDs, and joint injections (steroids/hyaluronic acid). Severe cases may require joint replacement. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, OA isn't systemic but can significantly impair quality of life. Assistive devices (braces, canes) help manage disability."
Arthritis,"Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain and stiffness.Arthritis encompasses 100+ joint disorders, primarily osteoarthritis (wear-and-tear) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, autoimmune). RA causes symmetrical joint swelling, morning stiffness >1 hour, and systemic symptoms (fatigue, fever). Diagnosis involves clinical exam, RF/anti-CCP antibodies, and imaging. Treatment includes NSAIDs, DMARDs (methotrexate), and biologics (TNF inhibitors) to slow progression. Untreated RA leads to joint deformity. Gout (urate crystal deposition) and psoriatic arthritis are other types. Early aggressive treatment preserves joint function. Physical therapy and assistive devices improve mobility across all arthritis types."
(vertigo) Paroymsal Positional Vertigo,"(Vertigo) Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is a type of dizziness caused by specific head movements.Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo causes brief, intense spinning sensations triggered by head movements (e.g., rolling over in bed). It results from displaced otoconia (ear crystals) in semicircular canals. Diagnosis uses the Dix-Hallpike test. The Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning) is 90% effective after 1-3 sessions. Vestibular suppressants (meclizine) help temporarily but delay compensation. Most cases resolve spontaneously within weeks but may recur. Differential diagnosis includes vestibular neuritis or Meniere's disease. Chronic cases benefit from vestibular rehabilitation therapy to promote CNS compensation."
Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells.Acne vulgaris is a pilosebaceous unit disorder influenced by hormones, bacteria (C. acnes), and excess sebum. Lesions range from comedones (blackheads/whiteheads) to inflammatory papules/pustules or severe cystic nodules. Treatment includes topical retinoids (normalize keratinization), benzoyl peroxide (antibacterial), and oral antibiotics (doxycycline) for moderate cases. Severe acne may require isotretinoin (causes birth defects—strict contraception required). Hormonal therapies (oral contraceptives, spironolactone) help women. Proper skincare (non-comedogenic products) prevents exacerbation. Untreated acne leads to scarring; early intervention improves outcomes. Diet's role (high glycemic/dairy) remains debated."
Urinary tract infection,"Urinary tract infection is an infection in any part of the urinary system.UTIs are bacterial infections (usually E. coli from gut flora) affecting the urethra (urethritis), bladder (cystitis), or kidneys (pyelonephritis). Symptoms include dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain. Fever/flank pain suggest kidney involvement. Diagnosis requires urinalysis and culture. Treatment is tailored antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim). Recurrent UTIs may need prophylactic antibiotics or post-coital treatment. Prevention includes hydration, voiding after intercourse, and cranberry products (modest benefit). Catheter-associated UTIs are a major nosocomial concern. Untreated pyelonephritis can cause sepsis, especially in elderly where symptoms may be atypical (confusion)."
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and scaly patches.Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder causing rapid keratinocyte proliferation, leading to thick, scaly plaques (often on elbows/knees/scalp). Triggers include stress, infections (strep throat), and medications. Nail pitting and arthritis (psoriatic arthritis) may accompany. Diagnosis is clinical; biopsy rarely needed. Treatment ranges from topical steroids/vitamin D analogs to phototherapy or systemic drugs (methotrexate, biologics like TNF inhibitors). Comorbidities include cardiovascular disease and depression. No cure exists, but modern biologics achieve near-clearance. Lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, weight loss) improve outcomes. Guttate psoriasis often follows streptococcal infections in young adults."
Impetigo,"Impetigo is a highly contagious skin infection causing red sores that can break open.Impetigo is a highly contagious superficial skin infection caused by S. aureus or S. pyogenes, common in children. It presents as honey-colored crusted lesions (non-bullous type) or fluid-filled blisters (bullous type). Spread occurs through direct contact or fomites. Diagnosis is clinical; cultures guide treatment if MRSA suspected. Topical mupirocin treats localized cases; oral antibiotics (cephalexin) are needed for extensive infections. Hygiene (handwashing, not sharing towels) prevents spread. Complications include cellulitis or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (rare). Differential diagnosis includes herpes simplex or eczema herpeticum. Lesions typically heal without scarring if properly treated."
